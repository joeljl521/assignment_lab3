1)Problem 1
While loop runs @ sz-1 in the first iteration, sz-2 for second iteration and down to 1 one for the last iteration. Total iteration is (sz-1)*sz/2. Each while loop has a if statement, the time complexity is O(sz^2).
2)Problem 2
You can weigh all 20 bags at once to get the total(20.1) grams. After remove one bag after another, recording the difference that was removed. Which is usually 1.0 grams but once 1.1 comes up then that will be the heavy bag.
